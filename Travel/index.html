      <h2>Auckland - The City of Sails</h2>
      <p>New Zealand’s largest city – often mistaken as the country’s capital – is called the City of Sails because of its numerous yacht marinas and sailboats anchoring offshore. But even though a lot of Auckland’s population spends their time on the water
        or exploring the surrounding countryside the city is buzzing with life in the evenings and on weekends. The best views over the 1.4 million people city can be admired from the Sky Tower or One Tree Hill, a formerly active volcano.

        <h3>LOTR Movie Sites</h3>
        <p>Ever since the first The Lord of the Rings movie was released in 2001, New Zealand has been known as the 'Home of Middle-earth'. New Zealand’s dramatic scenery plays the mythical world of Middle-earth on the big screen in both The Lord of the
          Rings and The Hobbit Trilogy. More than 150 locations throughout the country were used to film two Tolkein trilogies.
